Error code 0:   typically indicates success, such as a 
                successful login. You can use it to 
                handle scenarios like redirecting the user 
                to their dashboard or displaying a success 
                message.

Error code 1:   can indicate that a required parameter, like 
                the username or password, is missing. It's 
                used to prompt users to provide both a 
                username and password for the login process 
                to proceed.

Error code 2:   can indicate that a specific resource, like 
                the user, was not found. For instance, if a 
                user with the provided username does not exist 
                in the database, you can use this code to inform 
                the user that the username they entered is not 
                registered.

Error code 3:   typically indicates an incorrect password. 
                It's used to notify the user that the password 
                they entered doesn't match the password associated 
                with the provided username.

Error code 500: Signifies internal server issues, like 
                database problems or unexpected errors, 
                not directly caused by user actions.
